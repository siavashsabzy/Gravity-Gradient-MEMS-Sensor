AB  - We present the fabrication and test results of a novel inertial sensor for use onboard satellites, to obtain the Earth vector. Current state-of-the-art Earth sensors determine the Earth vector by imaging the Earthâ€™s horizon in the IR. This requires multiple optical heads on different faces of the satellite, with associated mounting and thermal considerations. The MEMS-based approach reported here is based on measuring the gravity gradient vector by measuring the gravity gradient torque on a 4 cm long Si-pendulum. This approach eliminates the need for multiple external access ports, allowing a compact sensor to be situated anywhere inside the spacecraft.
